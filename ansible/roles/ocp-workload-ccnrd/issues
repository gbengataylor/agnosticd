WHAT sHould happen
all users should be able to log into
gogs - and see their m1, m2 source codes - this is fine
keycloak
che 
rhamt
all users should have access to jenkins 

each user should have an inventory and catalog

ISSUES
git failed ---bastion didn't have git

rhamt users not set - looks like keycloak not setup -- i see errors in the log
--- script couldn't get the token from rhmat sso,however when running from command line locally and on bastion it worked
-- ran it again in playbookk but it failed
-- looks like issue is jq isn't isntalled

codeready users not set
-- looks like cause is SSO_TOKEN not set correctly
--stackid not set
-- workspaces not created
-- able to get access token when running curl command outside playbook
-- looks like issue is jq isnt installed

-- however, workspaces not pre-creatednn
 --- looks like wget is missing

jenkins doesn't seem to be working for non-admin users -- TODO -- might be fine go through the lab

not all gogs users are sets -- fixed

might need to change USERCOUNT in preparelab_cnn -- doesn't seem to take the passed in user

issue - http://guides-m1-labs-infra.apps.proxy-test.redhatgov.io/workshop/cloudnative/lab/migrate-to-jboss-eap - step 14 - link to openfhist console is wrong..internal
---check if same with rhpds
--no it's not becuser oc whoami --show-server 
-- in both envs make sure to sign on using the oc command and the external server name


TO TRY
attempt on rhpds - maybe..make sure you log into bastion and log in as admin, make sure git and jq are installed
attempt to install codeready worksapaces 2


users
starts with user0..create user0 for openshift - just leave as is...user0 could be professor #
when testing use user0

-- in both envs make sure to sign on using the oc command and the external server name before 

TO Fix
does it use the user_count set in the env before running the playbook?
--ansible playbook should be -e"num_users=${USER_COUNT}" \ ..fix that.

maybe add a task to make sure git is present in workload.yml?
maybe add a task to make sure jq is installed
maybe add a task to make sure wget is installed

FOR SEC
make sure to run the pre-load tasks for devsecops, make sure the tools like git,jq,wget are installed
CREATE user0-user80 on openshift
for CCN create up to 80
